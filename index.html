            <p class="story-text">The Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized use of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds in the United States, a crucial step in the nation’s steady recovery from the pandemic and a boon to millions of American families eager for a return to normalcy.</p>
            <p class="story-text">The authorization caps weeks of anticipation among parents, who have been grappling with how to conduct their lives when only the adults in a household are immunized. It removes an obstacle to school reopenings by reducing the threat of transmission in classrooms, and affords more of the nearly 17 million children in this age group opportunities to attend summer camps, sleepovers and Little League games.</p>

            <h1 class="story-title">BREAKING: The Knicks Are Back!</h1>
            <img class="story-img" src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b97/8cf/0d14d4b9e6a9c239b4606fdf4c124c8fc2-knicks.2x.rhorizontal.w700.jpg" alt="knick goes for a layup" /> 
            <p class="story-text">NEW YORK - The Knicks played so badly last year they weren’t invited to the NBA Bubble in Orlando to finish their games. They had a 21-45 record in the pandemic-shortened season, for a winning percentage that looked good only if you thought of it as a batting average. They lost their coach, their fifth in as many years, and failed to score a single marquee free agent in the off-season — usually a must if you want to stay relevant. That the Knicks had been pegged as a bottom Eastern Conference team coming into 2021 didn’t stop me from watching, of course. It’s an annual ritual to see how many scoring droughts and blown leads I can stomach before turning off the TV in disgust.</p>
            <p class="story-text">But almost from the start of the new season, this team was different. Under the new regime of president Leon Rose and coach Tom Thibodeau, one of the best strategic minds in the game, the Knicks have put a disciplined, fiercely contending lineup on the court every night and pulled out unlikely wins in a blitz of steals, blocked shots, and step-back jumpers. Several Knicks are having career seasons. After years of tripping over their laces, the surging team — which won 10 of its last 11 and knocked off some of the best teams in the league — is in the thick of a heated playoff race.</p>

            <p class="story-text">WASHINGTON — President Biden ordered the Labor Department on Monday to ensure that unemployed Americans cannot draw enhanced federal jobless benefits if they turn down a suitable job offer, even as he rejected claims by Republicans that his weekly unemployment bonus is undermining efforts to get millions of Americans back to work.</p>
            <p class="story-text">Stung from a weekend of criticism over a disappointing April jobs report, Mr. Biden struck a defiant tone, seeking to make clear that he expects workers to return to jobs if they are available, while defending his signature economic policy effort thus far and blaming corporate America, in part, for not doing more to entice people to go back to work.</p>

            <p class="story-text">The former presidential candidate won a major endorsement in the New York City mayor’s race from Rep. Grace Meng, a top Asian-American leader in Queens.</p>
            <p class="story-text">When Andrew Yang ran for president last year, the surprising staying power of his candidacy was powered by a fiercely loyal, politically diverse group of supporters often referred to as the “Yang Gang.”</p>
            <p class="story-text">He also enthusiastically embraced his Taiwanese-American background, drawing support from Asian-American voters, even as he occasionally fed stereotypical tropes like describing himself as “an Asian man who likes math.”</p>
